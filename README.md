# Face-Mask-Detection
## Overview
This project involves creating a deep learning model to classify images of people with or without masks using a dataset from Kaggle. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to tackle the classification task (Deep Learning) and integrates real-time prediction capabilities. The project aims to explore how machine learning can contribute to public health and safety measures.

## Why I Started
I started this project during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the idea of creating technology to promote and ensure mask compliance. It was a chance to learn about image classification and neural networks while creating a practical solution that can contribute to a meaningful goal. My goal was to build a reliable and accurate model and develop skills in deep learning and DL.

## Achievements
- Achieved **93.87% test accuracy** using a custom CNN model.
- Gained hands-on experience in image preprocessing, model optimization, and evaluation.

## Skills Learned
- **Image Processing**: Resizing, normalizing, and converting images to NumPy arrays.
- **Model Design**: Building and optimizing CNNs with convolution, pooling, and dropout layers.
- **Evaluation**: Using classification reports, precision, and recall to assess performance.

## Challenges
-  Optimized model performance by tuning hyperparameters and addressing overfitting using dropout layers and early stopping.
- Evaluated the model rigorously, ensuring balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1-score, which required refining the dataset and model parameters.
